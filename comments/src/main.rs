fn main() {
    // Comments are of three types
    // -> // are called line comments
    // /* */ -> are called block comments
    // /// or //! -> are called doc comments which are parsed to generate HTML documentation

    // /* */ comments can be nested
    // block comments can also be used to easily mainpulate expressions. For ex:
    let x = 5 + /* 90 */ + 5
    println!("Hello, world!");
